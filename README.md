# IS1200 Computer Hardware Engineering  

## Overview  
This repository contains coursework for **IS1200 Computer Hardware Engineering** at KTH. The course focuses on low-level programming, computer architecture, and hardware-software interactions.  

The project is divided into two main parts:  
1. **Labs** – Covering assembly programming, I/O programming, and processor design.  
2. **Mini Project** – A hardware/software project applying concepts learned in the course.  

## Labs  
The lab assignments cover key hardware and software concepts:  
- **Lab 1: Assembly Programming** – Writing and analyzing MIPS assembly code.  
- **Lab 3: I/O Programming** – Implementing GPIO, timers, and interrupt handling.  
- **Lab 4: Processor Design** – Designing a simple single-cycle processor using Logisim.  

Each lab includes exercises, code implementations, and reports.  

## Mini Project  
The mini-project applies concepts from the labs to build and test a hardware/software system. More details can be found in the **Mini Project** folder.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Programming Languages:** C, MIPS Assembly  
- **Tools & Simulators:** MARS, Logisim, MCB32tools  
- **Hardware:** chipKIT Uno32, Basic I/O Shield
